# Web components with Stencil

This is a practice-project where I explore Web Components with StencilJS.
Stencil is a great tool to simplify and customise Web components. With this project I aim to practice and perfect the usage of Stencil functionalities.

## Installation

As this project is just for practice purposes, I'm not considering publishing it to npm, at the moment.
If it will grow in size and its component become useful for my side-projects, I will make it available.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome! Any feedback on blind spots of these components are more than welcome.
